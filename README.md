# etheoo's CS:GO Config
Welcome to etheoo's CS:GO Config. This is my personal config Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, that I've decided to upload here for convienience. You can use this as a basis for your own config, as I recommended that you tweak the settings according to your own setup and preference. The .cfg file can be edited through any text editor.
